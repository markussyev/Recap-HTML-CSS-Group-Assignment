                    While the exact origins of cabbage rolls remain unclear, their history in Ukrainian cuisine dates back centuries. Some researchers believe that this dish may have originated in ancient Roman times when cabbage leaf wraps were a popular dish. Ukrainians adapted this dish to their culinary preferences, adding their own unique ingredients and flavor combinations.

                    While the main ingredients of cabbage rolls are cabbage and meat filling, recipes may vary depending on the region. In Western Ukraine, for example, sour cream may be added to the sauce, while in the East, a wider variety of spices may be used.

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
 
Freeze the cabbages 3 days before you need it. The night before defrost cabbage and keep them in the fridge until you are ready.
Cook rice in plenty water the same way you would pasta until al dente for approximately 5 minutes after the water boils. It shouldn't be too soft. Drain and set aside.
In a frying pan heat olive oil and cook onions over low heat for 7-10 minutes until tender.
Grate carrots. In a large bowl combine beef, pork, parsley, onions, carrots, rice, salt and pepper.
In a medium bowl whisk together stock, crushed tomatoes and creme fraiche, salt and pepper. Set aside.
Place your head of cabbage on a cutting board, cut off the bottom and pull the leaves away from the stalk. Repeat with the second head of cabbage.
Preheat your oven to 350F/180C.
Clear your work space, so all ingredients are within reach. Take a cabbage leaf and cut the rib down, so it's not too thick. Put 2 tbsp of filling at the bottom of the wide part of a leaf (see picture above) and roll it like a burrito, tucking sides in. Your cabbage rolls will vary in size slightly depending on the size of cabbage leaves. You will have approximately 30-32 cabbage rolls.
Pour a cup of the sauce on the bottom of your cast iron casserole or any other heavy bottom casserole and start stacking your cabbage rolls. Half way through add a couple of bay leaves and â…“ of the sauce and continue stacking until all cabbage rolls are gone.
Pour the remaining sauce over cabbage rolls, cover with a lid and bake in the oven for 1 hour. Then take the lid off and bake for 30 more minutes. Serve with additional sour cream or creme fraiche and fresh herbs like dill and parsley.
